Abstract: COV-19 has a huge impact on the world, and it has also affected the normal lives of many people in Canada. As for the homeless crowd, they have been greatly affected after the government introduced restrictions on the number of indoor people. I hope to observe the impact of the epidemic on their residences through this experiment.

The data set show all the active shelters serving the City of Toronto. Included in the dataset is the name of the shelter, program name, sector served addresses,program capacity and the number of people that occupied those space. Among them, The blog is most interested in the relationship between sector, capacity and occupancy before 2020/09/19. This study will divide 5 different types of sector and observe their occupancy rates in different months.

```{r}
#Find out the occupancy rate from data
dat$OCCUPANCY_RATE = dat$OCCUPANCY / dat$CAPACITY
#Set the occupancy rate equal to 0 when capacity and occupancy are 0
dat[is.na(dat)] = 0
```

```{r}
#Divided 5 different types of sectors into 5 groups and help people know the occupancy rate in different groups before 2020/09/19
female = dat[which(dat$SECTOR=='Women'),]
male = dat[which(dat$SECTOR=='Men'),]
family = dat[which(dat$SECTOR=='Families'),]
teen = dat[which(dat$SECTOR=='Youth'),]
both = dat[which(dat$SECTOR=='Co-ed'),]
```

```{r}
#Calculate all dates in months
dat$month = format(as.Date(dat$OCCUPANCY_DATE),'%m')
```

```{r}
#Calculate the total occupancy rate
occtotal = aggregate(dat$OCCUPANCY, by=list(Category=dat$month), FUN=sum)
captotal = aggregate(dat$CAPACITY, by=list(Category=dat$month), FUN=sum)
rate = occtotal$x / captotal$x
```

```{r}
#Observe the total change through ggplot
tmp = data.frame('month'=unique(dat$month),'rate'=rate)
ggplot(data=tmp, aes(x=month, y=rate, group=1)) +
  geom_line() + 
  geom_point()
```

First see a general overview from the first picture. We can observe that there was about 95% occupancy rate in January, and there was a slight decrease in February but not obvious. This should be a normal amount of change. In March, there was a downward trend, but it could still be maintained at more than 90%. At that time, it should have been the detection of COV-19 cases in Canada, but no isolation measures had begun. In April, the occupancy rate began to show a cliff-like decline, by about 10%. This should be the beginning of the government's isolation measures and plans to limit the number of people indoors to a safer number. In May, the occupancy rate continued to drop to around 70%. By June, the occupancy rate dropped to 65%. It should be that the government has taken further measures to further regulate the number of residents indoors. Therefore, the residences also follow the government's requirements and limit the number of residents. When it drops to its lowest point in July, all residents can ensure that social disrance is maintained. In August, the occupancy rate began to pick up. It should be that the epidemic is slowly being brought under control, Ontario is beginning to unblock, people can return to their jobs, and residences can start to accommodate more homeless people. Crowd, everything is starting to develop for the better. However, the occupancy rate began to decline in September, because the epidemic has recently rebounded, and the relevant departments have renewed attention to the number of indoor residents.

```{r}
female$month = format(as.Date(female$OCCUPANCY_DATE),'%m')
```

```{r}
#Observe the monthly occupancy rate with shelter only accept woman
occfemale = aggregate(female$OCCUPANCY, by=list(Category=female$month), FUN=sum)
capfemale = aggregate(female$CAPACITY, by=list(Category=female$month), FUN=sum)
rate = occfemale$x / capfemale$x
tmp = data.frame('month'=unique(female$month),'rate'=rate)
ggplot(data=tmp, aes(x=month, y=rate, group=1)) +
  geom_line() + 
  geom_point()
```

The second picture is the study object of the residence that only accommodates female population, and observes the occupancy of female population. It can be seen from the image that the change in the female occupancy rate is roughly the same as the overall change.


```{r}
male$month = format(as.Date(male$OCCUPANCY_DATE),'%m')
```

```{r}
#Observe the monthly occupancy rate with shelter only accept man
occmale = aggregate(male$OCCUPANCY, by=list(Category=male$month), FUN=sum)
capmale = aggregate(male$CAPACITY, by=list(Category=male$month), FUN=sum)
rate = occmale$x / capmale$x
tmp = data.frame('month'=unique(male$month),'rate'=rate)
ggplot(data=tmp, aes(x=month, y=rate, group=1)) +
  geom_line() + 
  geom_point()
```

The third person is the research object of the shelter that only accommodates men. It can be seen that in January, the occupancy rate was about 98%. From January to March, there was only a slight decline. In April, like the overall change, it showed a cliff-like decline until it reached its lowest point in June. However, compared with those that only accommodate females, the number of accommodations for men has increased significantly after June, and in September the occupancy rate rose to 77%.



```{r}
family$month = format(as.Date(family$OCCUPANCY_DATE),'%m')
```


```{r}
#Observe the monthly occupancy rate with shelter only accept family
occfamily= aggregate(family$OCCUPANCY, by=list(Category=family$month), FUN=sum)
capfamily = aggregate(family$CAPACITY, by=list(Category=family$month), FUN=sum)
rate = occfamily$x / capfamily$x
tmp = data.frame('month'=unique(family$month),'rate'=rate)
ggplot(data=tmp, aes(x=month, y=rate, group=1)) +
  geom_line() + 
  geom_point()
```

The fourth picture is the research object of shelters that only take in families. From the picture, it can be seen that the occupancy rate of this type of shelter has been steadily and continuously decreasing since January, with little change, and the whole curve shows a downward trend. There was no rebound trend by September.


```{r}
teen$month = format(as.Date(teen$OCCUPANCY_DATE),'%m')
```


```{r}
#Observe the monthly occupancy rate with shelter only accept youth
occteen = aggregate(teen$OCCUPANCY, by=list(Category=teen$month), FUN=sum)
capteen = aggregate(teen$CAPACITY, by=list(Category=teen$month), FUN=sum)
rate = occteen$x / capteen$x
tmp = data.frame('month'=unique(teen$month),'rate'=rate)
ggplot(data=tmp, aes(x=month, y=rate, group=1)) +
  geom_line() + 
  geom_point()
```

The fifth graph shows the occupancy rate of young people only. In the first three months, the decline was only a small change, and it began to show a relatively large change in April, and the change was the largest in May, falling from 89% to 76%. In June, the occupancy rate still fell and reached its lowest point. But in July, there was a sharp rebound. In July, the occupancy rate rose from 73% to 87%. In August and September, it started to decline slightly.

```{r}
both$month = format(as.Date(both$OCCUPANCY_DATE),'%m')
```

```{r}
##Observe the monthly occupancy rate with shelter accept all gender
occboth = aggregate(both$OCCUPANCY, by=list(Category=both$month), FUN=sum)
capboth = aggregate(both$CAPACITY, by=list(Category=both$month), FUN=sum)
rate = occboth$x / capboth$x
tmp = data.frame('month'=unique(both$month),'rate'=rate)
ggplot(data=tmp, aes(x=month, y=rate, group=1)) +
  geom_line() + 
  geom_point()
```

The last picture is the research unit of the shelter that accommodates all genders. The chances did not change much in the first three months, but there was a big drop in April, from 98% to 86%. In May it continued to drop to 83%. In June, it dropped to the lowest point of 74%. In July, it rebounded to 83%, which was the same high as in May. There was a slow decline in August and September.

Compare to the other types of sectors, family have more affection during this period. In my opinion, what the institutions should have done a better job to accomodate families. Perhaps the family-based population base is relatively large, so when the number of people indoors is limited, the family-based population will not be as welcomed to the shelters. I hope that this category of people can be given greater help in terms of housing. In addition, I hope that the epidemic can be better controlled and these people can return to a more normal life as soon as possible.
